# About

## What
Fully Booked premieres in 2017 as the only art book fair in the United Arab Emirates, responding to an absence of international art book fairs in the region. The fair will serve as a platform to consider the medium of the artist book as a “multi-site”—a tactile, portable, and accessible form. This form allows for the creative and democratic dissemination of information, while simultaneously enabling intimacy with content. The intention of the fair is to foster meaningful cultural exchanges between regional and international artist publishers, as well as the cultural practitioners and visitors present in Dubai during the week.

This event, which is a unique contribution to that most active time for Dubai’s art culture, will effectively act as a satellite event to the concurrent art fairs and biennial. Fully Booked creates a free, alternative art space for the public to engage with tactile artworks that can be easily collected, sparking dialogue within a diverse group.

## When
Fully Booked will open as an exhibition on March 13th, 2017, and will be open for two weeks, coinciding with Dubai Art Week and the openings of the eleventh edition of the Art Dubai fair and the thirteenth Sharjah Biennial. The fair will be held in the same warehouse space and will run from March 16–18th.

## Where
Fully Booked will be hosted by [Alserkal Avenue](http://alserkalavenue.ae/en/index.php), the region’s foremost arts hub. Situated in Dubai’s industrial quarter, the Avenue is a cluster of architect-designed warehouses. It is home to interspersed public spaces that bring together collaborators from diverse artistic disciplines, encouraging open dialogue, sharing of ideas, and a collaborative work ethic that can see these creative ideas come to life.

## Why

The concept of this fair stems from the idea of the artist book as a multi-site; books, like exhibitions, are spatial explorations of artists’ concepts and designs. In a sense, viewers can explore these spaces via artists’ books produced in multiples—without the necessity of being tied to a single location. This fair is a unique opportunity to explore the potential of the multi-site through the intersection of various cultures and creative practices in Dubai. Fully Booked will accent and complement the transcultural identity of Dubai and the UAE.
